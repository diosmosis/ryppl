About this documentation
========================

This documentation is written in `reStructuredText

``boost-git-docs`` branch of the git repository at

.. rubric:: Why alt dot boost?

Because this neither official boost nor currently proposed.  It is a
separate effort that proceeds independently of upstream boost.
