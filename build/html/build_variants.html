<h1>Build Variants<a class="headerlink" href="#build-variants" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Different compilation and linking flags affect how source code and
libraries are compiled. Boost&#8217;s build system abstracts some of these
properties into specific &#8216;&#8217;features&#8217;&#8217; of the build, which indicate (at
a high level) what options are being used, e.g., multi-threaded,
release-mode, shared libraries, etc. Each feature brings with it
certain compilation options (which vary from one compiler to the next)
that need to be used when building that variant. For example, on Unix
systems, one often must link against the <cite>pthread</cite> library for
multi-threaded programs and libraries, which requires the addition of
the <cite>-lpthread</cite> flag to the link line. The &#8216;&#8217;features&#8217;&#8217; feature of the
build system encapsulates this knowledge.</p>
<p>A library built with a given set of features is called a library
<cite>variant</cite>. For example, we could have a multi-threaded release variant
of a shared library, which would be built with all of the options
needed to support multi-threading, optimization, elimination of
debugging symbols, and for building a shared library. Each variant of
a library is given a unique name based on the features in that
variant, so that one can readily identify the library, for example,
<cite>libboost_signals-gcc40-mt-d.so</cite> is the multi-threaded, debug version
of the shared library for Boost.Signals on a typical Linux system. The
[<a class="reference" href="http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/windows.html#library-naming">http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/windows.html#library-naming</a>
Boost Getting Started guide] describes the library naming conventions
used for the variants.</p>
<p>This page describes each of the featues supported by Boost.Build, and
the default variants that are built for each platform.</p>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h2>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CMake-based build system for Boost supports the following
features.</p>
<p id="index-1"><cite>STATIC</cite></p>
<blockquote>
The <cite>STATIC</cite> feature identifies static builds of libraries, i.e.,
a <cite>.lib</cite> (library) file on Microsoft Windows or a <cite>.a</cite> (archive)
file on Unix systems.</blockquote>
<p id="index-2"><cite>SHARED</cite></p>
<blockquote>
The <cite>SHARED</cite> feature identifies shared builds of libraries, i.e.,
a <cite>.dll</cite> (dynamically linked library) file on Microsoft Windows or
a <cite>.so`(shared object) or `.dylib</cite> (dynamic library) file on Unix
systems. In some cases, <cite>SHARED</cite> variants actually refer to
&#8220;modules&#8221;, which are a special kind of shared library on some
systems (e.g., Mac OS X).</blockquote>
<p id="index-3"><cite>DEBUG</cite></p>
<blockquote>
The <cite>DEBUG</cite> feature identifies builds of libraries that retain
complete debugging information and prohibit optimization, making
these builds far easier to use for debugging programs.</blockquote>
<p id="index-4"><cite>RELEASE</cite></p>
<blockquote>
The <cite>RELEASE</cite> feature identifies builds of libraries that use full
optimization and eliminate extraneous information such as debug
symbols, resulting in builds of libraries that are typically much
smaller than (and execute faster than) their debug library
counterparts.</blockquote>
<p id="index-5"><cite>SINGLE_THREADED</cite></p>
<blockquote>
The <cite>SINGLE_THREADED</cite> feature identifies builds of libraries that
assume that the program using them is single-threaded. These
libraries typically avoid costly atomic operations or locks, and
make use of no multi-threaded features.</blockquote>
<p id="index-6"><cite>MULTI_THREADED</cite></p>
<blockquote>
The <cite>MULTI_THREADED</cite> feature identifies builds of libraries that
assume that the program using them is multi-threaded. These
libraries may introduce additional code (relative to their
single-threaded variants) that improves the behavior of the
library in a multi-threade context, often at the cost of
single-thread performance.</blockquote>
<p id="index-7"><cite>STATIC_RUNTIME</cite></p>
<blockquote>
The <cite>STATIC_RUNTIME</cite> feature identifies builds that link against
the C and C++ run-time libraries statically, which directly
includes the code from those run-time libraries into the Boost
library or executable.</blockquote>
<p id="index-8"><cite>DYNAMIC_RUNTIME</cite></p>
<blockquote>
The <cite>DYNAMIC_RUNTIME</cite> feature identifies builds that link against
the dynamic C and C++ run-time libraries.</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="compilation-and-linker-options">
<h2>Compilation and Linker Options<a class="headerlink" href="#compilation-and-linker-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For each feature, the Boost build system defines three macros
providing compilation flags, linking flags, and extra libraries to
link against when using that feature. These flags are automatically
added to the build commands for variants using that feature. The
particular flags and libraries are described by the following global
variables:</p>
<p><cite>feature_COMPILE_FLAGS</cite></p>
<blockquote>
A string containing extra flags that will be added to the compile
line, including macro definitions and compiler-specific flags
needed to enable this particular feature.</blockquote>
<p><cite>feature_LINK_FLAGS</cite></p>
<blockquote>
A string containing extra flags that will be added to the
beginning of the link line. Note that these flags should &#8216;&#8217;&#8216;not&#8217;&#8216;&#8217;
contain extra libraries that one needs to link against. Those
should go into <cite>feature_LINK_LIBS</cite>.</blockquote>
<p><cite>feature_LINK_LIBS</cite></p>
<blockquote>
A CMake list containing the names of additional libraries that
will be linked into libraries and executables that require this
feature. The elements in this list should name the library (e.g.,
<cite>pthread</cite>) rather than providing the link command itself (e.g.,
<cite>-lpthread</cite>), so that linking will be more portable.</blockquote>
<p>Each of these variables can be expanded for any feature, e.g.,
<cite>MULTI_THREADED_LINK_LIBS</cite> contains libraries that multi-threaded
variants should link against.</p>
<p>All of the flags provided for each feature are typically detected by
the Boost CMake configuration module in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tools/build/CMake/BoostConfig.cmake</span></tt>.</p>

<h2>Default Variants<a class="headerlink" href="#default-variants" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By default, Boost&#8217;s build system will build every permutation of
libraries in the space (<cite>STATIC</cite> or <cite>SHARED</cite>) x (<cite>DEBUG</cite> or <cite>RELEASE</cite>)
x (<cite>SINGLE_THREADED</cite> or <cite>MULTI_THREADED</cite>), resulting in 8 different
copies of each library. On Windows, where the distinction between
static and dynamic run-time libraries is very important, the default
build also creates permutations with (<cite>STATIC_RUNTIME</cite> or
<cite>DYNAMIC_RUNTIME</cite>). Certain non-sensical combinations of libraries
will automatically be eliminated, e.g., it does not generally make
sense to create a shared library that links against the static C and
C++ run-time libraries. However, this still means that the default
build creates between 8 and 12 different variants of each Boost
library.</p>
<p>Users who only need a few variants of each library can change which
variants of Boost libraries are build by default using various
configuration options. For each feature, CMake&#8217;s configuration will
contain an option <cite>BUILD_feature</cite>. When the feature is ON, the build
system will produce variants with that feature. When the feature is
OFF, the build system will suppress variants with that feature. For
example, toggling <cite>BUILD_DEBUG</cite> to <cite>OFF</cite> will inhibit the creation of
the debug variants, drastically improving overall build times.</p>
