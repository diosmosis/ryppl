Testing
=======

Boost's CMake-based build system provides regression testing via
`CTest <http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Testing_With_CTest>`_, which
comes as part of CMake. This regression testing system can be used by
Boost developers to test their libraries locally and also by testers
and users to submit regression tests to a `CDash server
<http://www.cdash.org/CDashPublic/index.php?project=Boost>`_, which
collects and reports regression-testing results from different
sites. This document assumes that the reader has already learned how
to build and configure Boost using CMake.

.. _BUILD_REGRESSION_TESTS:
.. index:: BUILD_REGRESSION_TESTS
.. _BOOST_TEST_LIBRARIES:
.. index:: BOOST_TEST_LIBRARIES

.. index:: testing ; speeding up 

Re-run the CMake configuration for Boost, after setting
``BUILD_REGRESSION_TESTS`` to ``ON``. You may notice that
configuration takes significantly longer when we are building all of
the regression tests.  You may enable regression testing for only a
subset of Boost libraries (this speeds configuration and build time)
by setting the variable ``BOOST_TEST_LIBRARIES`` to a semicolon
separated list of library names, e.g. (from the CMakeCache.txt) ::

  spirit;serialization;variant

Be sure to re-configure CMake once you are done tweaking these
options, and generate makefiles or project files, by clicking *OK* (on
Microsoft Windows) or pressing :kbd:`g` (on Unix).

If you know what you're going to be testing, you can simplify the
whole process with e.g. ::

   cmake ../src -DBUILD_REGRESSION_TESTS=ON -DBOOST_TEST_LIBRARIES=mpi;graph_parallel

.. _the_dashboard:

The Dashboard
-------------

Donated by kitware, it is here:

http://www.cdash.org/CDashPublic/index.php?project=Boost


Build
-----

      
Following the same building process described in :ref:`quickstart`.
For Unix users, don't forget the `-i` option to `make`, and also
possibly `-j 2` (or more) to run the build process in
parallel. Building all of the regression tests for the Boost libraries
can take a long time. ::

  make -i -j 2
 
.. note:: If you change Boost source files in a way that affects your
   	  tests, you will need to re-run the build process to update
   	  the libraries and tests before moving on to the next step.

Test
----

Once regression tests have finished building, go into the command line
or command prompt and enter the Boost binary directory. Then, run the
command::

  ctest

to execute all of the regression tests. The `ctest` executable will be
stored in the binary directory for CMake. On Unix platforms, this is
the same place where `ccmake` resides. On Windows platforms, it will
be in ``C:\Program Files\CMake\bin``. The ctest program should produce
output like the following::

  Start processing tests
  Test project /Users/dgregor/Projects/boost-darwin
    1/ 22 Testing any-any_test                    Passed

   22/ 22 Testing function-contains2_test         Passed
  
  100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 22


Here, we have only enabled testing of the Boost.Any and Boost.Function
libraries, by setting `TEST_BOOST_ANY` and `TEST_BOOST_FUNCTION` to
`ON` while all of the other `TEST_BOOST_`''LIBNAME'' options are set
to `OFF`.

.. warning:: Again, This ``ctest`` step runs the tests without first
   	     running a build.  If you change a source file and run the
   	     ``ctest`` step you will see that no build is invoked.

To run just a subset of the tests, pass ``-R`` and a regular
expression to ``ctest`` (see the output of ``ctest --help-full``). For
example, to run all of the Python tests, use::

  ctest -R python


There is also a ``-E`` (exclude) option which does the inverse of ``-R``.
``ctest --help`` shows the full list of options.

.. index:: targets ; testing
.. index:: testing ; targets

Targets
-------

The testing subsystem adds a toplevel target to the build.  In the
case of e.g. ``mpi``, (again when ``BUILD_REGRESSION_TESTS`` is on,
and ``BOOST_TEST_LIBRARIES`` is either empty or contains ``mpi``), the
target **mpi-test** will first build the test drivers, then run
``ctest -R mpi-``.  Example:  for intrusive, ::

  % make intrusive-test
  [  0%] Built target intrusive-multiset_test
  [  0%] Built target intrusive-splay_multiset_test
  ...
  [100%] Built target intrusive-avl_set_test
  [100%] Built target intrusive-sg_multiset_test

Submit Results
--------------

The ``ctest`` command can be used by individual developers to test
local changes to their libraries. The same program can also be used to
build all of Boost, run its regression tests, and submit the results
to a central server where others can view them. Currently, regression
test results based on the CMake build system are displayed on the Dart
server at http://www.cdash.org/CDashPublic/index.php?project=Boost

To submit "experimental" results to the Dart server, configure a Boost
binary tree by following the configuration instructions in the section
:ref:`quickstart`, and then enable regression testing via the
`BOOST_TESTING` option, as described above. At this point, don't build
anything! We'll let CTest do that work. You may want to customize some
of the advanced CMake options, such as `SITE` (to give your site
name), and `MAKECOMMAND` (which, for makefile targets, governs the
top-level make call when building Boost). Finally, go into the Boost
binary directory and execute::

  ctest -D Experimental

CTest will then reconfigure Boost, build all of the Boost libraries
and regression tests, execute the regression tests, and submit the
results to the Dart dashboard at
http://www.cdash.org/CDashPublic/index.php?project=Boost.  Results
submitted to the dashboard are usually browsable momentarily within a
minute or two.

.. note:: Although we are running regression tests on several flavors
   	  of Unix on a nightly basis, we have done very little work to
   	  ensure that regression testing runs smoothly on other
   	  platforms. We will remedy this problem in the near future.

Automatic testing
-----------------

Continuous 
^^^^^^^^^^

Here is a recommended setup.

Create a directory ``ctest`` on your test drone containing
subdirectories for the branches you'll be testing, in this case
*release* and *trunk*. ::

  boost/
    ctest/
      branches/
        release/
          continuous/ 
            build/        <= run ctest here
            src/          <= checkout to here
          nightly/    
            build/        <= run ctest here
            src/          <= checkout to here
    
and check out source to the directories listed above.  We'll do the
release branch as an example::

  % cd boost/ctest/branches/release
  % svn co http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/branches/release src
  #
  # lots of output
  #
  % mkdir continuous
  % cd continuous

now configure your build, enabling testing.  In this case I'll also
use an alternate compiler, from Intel::

  % cmake ../src -DBUILD_REGRESSION_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc
  -- The C compiler identification is Intel
  -- The CXX compiler identification is Intel
  -- Check for working C compiler: /opt/intel/Compiler/11.0/083/bin/intel64/icc
  -- Check for working C compiler: /opt/intel/Compiler/11.0/083/bin/intel64/icc -- works

     (etc)

  -- Configuring done
  -- Generating done
  -- Build files have been written to: /home/troy/Projects/boost/ctest/release/continuous/build

Now run ``ctest -D Continuous`` in a loop::

  % while true
  while> do
  while> ctest -D Continuous
  while> sleep 600   # take it easy on the repository
  while> done
     Site: zinc
     Build name: intel-11.0-linux
  Create new tag: 20090514-2207 - Continuous
  Start processing tests
  Updating the repository
     Updating the repository: /home/troy/Projects/boost/ctest/release/nightly/src
     Use SVN repository type
     Old revision of repository is: 53002
     New revision of repository is: 53005
     Gathering version information (one . per revision):

     (etc)

If you add ``-V or -VV`` you'll get a little more feedback about what
is going on.  On unix it is handy to do this via the utility *screen*.

.. todo:: Figure out how to do this on windows, encapsulate some of
   	  this scripting.  Just use the ctest builtin scripting
   	  language.


Nightly
^^^^^^^

Nightly testing should run triggered by a cron job or by Windows Task
Scheduler or what-have-you.  You will need,

* a directory to work in
* installed cmake/ctest/svn

but not a checkout of boost.  CTest will do the checkout, build, test
and submit on its own.

Create a directory to run in.  As in the previous section, we'll use
``boost/ctest/branches/release/nightly``, which I'll call ``$DIR``.
The CTest script should look like the following (you can copy/paste
this into ``$DIR/CTestNightly.cmake`` ::

  execute_process(COMMAND /bin/pwd
    OUTPUT_VARIABLE PWD
    OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
  
  message(STATUS "Running nightly build in ${PWD}")

  set(CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY ${PWD}/src)
  set(CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY ${PWD}/build)
  
  # what cmake command to use for configuring this dashboard
  set(CTEST_CMAKE_COMMAND "/usr/local/bin/cmake")
  set(CTEST_CTEST_COMMAND "/usr/local/bin/ctest")
  set(CTEST_CVS_COMMAND "svn")

  set(CTEST_CVS_CHECKOUT  "${CTEST_CVS_COMMAND} co https://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/branches/release ${CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY}")
  
  # which ctest command to use for running the dashboard
  set(CTEST_COMMAND
    "${CTEST_CTEST_COMMAND} -VV -D Experimental -A ${PWD}/notes.txt -O ctest.log"
    )
  
  
  
  ####################################################################
  # The values in this section are optional you can either
  # have them or leave them commented out
  ####################################################################
  
  # should ctest wipe the binary tree before running
  set(CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY TRUE)
  
  #
  # this is the initial cache to use for the binary tree, be careful to escape
  # any quotes inside of this string if you use it
  #
  # Yes you can pass cmake -DBUILD_WHATEVER=ON type options here.
  #
  set(CTEST_INITIAL_CACHE "

  CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:STRING=/opt/intel/Compiler/11.0/083/bin/intel64/icpc
  CMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING=/opt/intel/Compiler/11.0/083/bin/intel64/icc

  SITE:STRING=zinc
  MAKECOMMAND:STRING=make -i -j2
  DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT:STRING=30
  BUILD_REGRESSION_TESTS:STRING=ON
  CVSCOMMAND:FILEPATH=${CTEST_CVS_COMMAND}
  ")
  
You will need to customize several variables:

* **CTEST_CMAKE_COMMAND** the path to your cmake binary
* **CTEST_CTEST_COMMAND** the path to your ctest binary (should be in
  the same place as cmake)
* **CTEST_CVS_COMMAND** The path to subversion.
* **CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:STRING**, **CMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING** Note the
  syntax here, the trailing ``:STRING``.  If you are using a
  nonstandard compiler, set it here.
* **MAKECOMMAND:STRING** The path to your make command.  *NOTE* if you
  set this, be sure that the ``-i`` (ignore-errors) flag is included.
  If it isn't, the first compile/link error will stop the build and
  testing will commence.
* **SITE:STRING** This is what will appear as the 'hostname' in your
  posted dashboards.  Customize as you like.

Now you'll create a "notes" file, call it ``notes.txt``.  This will be
visible from the dashboard.   Add the output of, e.g::

  gcc --version
  uname -a

and the contents of the ``CTestNightly.cmake`` itself.  Example::
